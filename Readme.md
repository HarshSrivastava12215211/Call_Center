Call Center Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project
Project Overview:
In this project, I analyzed a call center dataset using Power BI to derive actionable insights that can help improve customer service operations. The goal was to understand call volumes, channel performance, customer sentiment, and common issues raised by customers, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation.

Key Contributions:

 Data Preparation:

Imported raw data from Excel/CSV files.

Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Power Query (e.g., handling nulls, formatting dates, creating calculated columns like total call duration in hours).

 Dashboard Design:

Created an interactive and user-friendly dashboard with filters by Channel, City, and State.

Designed KPIs to summarize important metrics such as:

Average Call Duration

Total Calls

Total Call Duration (mins & hrs)

Average Response Rate

 Visual Insights Delivered:

Map Visualization: Displayed call distribution by U.S. states to identify regional trends.

Donut Chart: Analyzed calls by communication channel (Call-Center, Chatbot, Email, Web).

Bar Charts:

Call Sentiment distribution (Very Positive to Very Negative)

Top Call Center Cities based on volume

Tree Map: Showed reasons for calls like Billing Questions, Payments, and Service Issues.

Included slicers for dynamic filtering by City, Channel, and State.

 Insights Uncovered:

Majority of calls were from the Call-Center channel (~32%).

Most common call reason was related to Billing Questions.

Los Angeles had the highest number of incoming calls among all cities.

Sentiment analysis revealed a high volume of negative and neutral customer interactions, suggesting a need to enhance service quality.

Tools Used:
Power BI, DAX (for calculated fields), Power Query (ETL), Data Visualization

Impact:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of call center operations, helping stakeholders identify pain points, monitor agent performance, and allocate resources more effectively. It can be extended for real-time monitoring or connected to a live database.
